These HTML webpages try to imitate the functions of a Digital Audio Workstation using only HTML, CSS and Javascript (so they work on a chromebook locally). 

In Chromebook_daw.html, you can upload and play multiple audio files and the same time onto different tracks, record audio using your microphone onto a track, split clips, copy and paste clips. 

In EQ.html, you can upload audio files, and play them while adjusting frequency bands that modify the volume of frequency regions. Right click on line to create new band, and right click on band to change shape from low shelf, high shelf and bell.

In MIDI_DAW_With Ideas, you can upload a midi file and play it with the native synth. But you can also upload your own sample by click one of the notes on the piano to the left, upload your audio sample, and the website will pitch shift the sample and map it to other notes so your midi file notes will trigger your sample.

Still working on coding more standard DAW features.

 Used Github Copilot. If you want to demo it, go to the demo link. But feel free to download the files you want to run from my repo (make sure to download the related .js and .css files along with the HTML files to ensure the webpage works properly).
