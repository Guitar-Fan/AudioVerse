These HTML webpages try to imitate the functions of a Digital Audio Workstation using only HTML, CSS and Javascript (so they work on a chromebook locally). 

Web Browser DAW (Chromebook_daw.html):  
You can upload and play multiple audio files at the same time onto different tracks, record audio using your microphone onto a track, split clips, copy and paste clips, quantize, fade, normalize, reverse, and export clips. Mixer view lets you adjust volume, pan, and EQ per track.

EQ Tool (EQ.html):  
Upload audio files and play them while adjusting frequency bands that modify the volume of frequency regions. Right click on line to create new band, and right click on band to change shape from low shelf, high shelf and bell. Export your EQ'd audio.

MIDI DAW (MIDI_DAW_With_Ideas.html):  
Upload a midi file and play it with the native synth. You can also upload your own sample by clicking one of the notes on the piano to the left, upload your audio sample, and the website will pitch shift the sample and map it to other notes so your midi file notes will trigger your sample.

Parameter Audio Editor (ParameterAudioEditor.html):  
Upload audio, visualize, tweak EQ, envelope, and pitch. Export your edits as WAV.

Wavetable Synth (Wavetable_Synth.html):  
Play and design sounds with a modern wavetable synthesizer. Export your creations as WAV.

Draw Audio (DrawAudio.html):  
Draw your own waveform and hear it instantly. Export as WAV for creative sound design.

Sound API Explorer (WebAudioAPIDemo/SoundAPI.html):  
Experiment with Web Audio API nodes and effects. Build and test audio chains visually.

Still working on coding more standard DAW features.

Used Github Copilot. If you want to demo it, go to the demo link. But feel free to download the files you want to run from my repo (make sure to download the related .js and .css files along with the HTML files to ensure the webpage works properly).
